# v1per-matrix

Cute lil LED Display Matrix that I plan to have on my desk to give me time and weather updates (mostly since I'm getting rid of my phone for the next 4 months so it would be nice to know the weather). Also, features a cutie (Hello Kitty)

## How It Works:
Really easy tbh! Just uses [WeatherAPI](https://weatherapi.com) plus some circuitpython and boom magic :P

Here's how its gonna look like (Pssst, press the image to see a video) <br><br>
